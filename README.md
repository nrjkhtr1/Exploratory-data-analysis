# Exploratory-data-analysis
I have performed a detail exploratory data analysis on some of the haberman and iris dataset. This repository constains very basic codes which can be helpful for beginners.

## Requirements
In order to run this you need to have:
  1. Python 3.5 (or higher)
  2. Numpy
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Pandas
  
  
## Usage
Run the Iris Data set EDA.ipynb
```bash
Iris Data set EDA.ipynb
```

Run the Haberman Data set.ipynb
```bash
Iris Data set EDA.ipynb
```

## Purpose
We created this recommendation system as a part of our CS 386 (IIT Goa) course.


## Contributing
Any suggestions in improving are appreciated.
