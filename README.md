# Exploratory-data-analysis
I have performed a detail exploratory data analysis on some of the haberman and iris dataset. This repository constains very basic codes which can be helpful for beginners.

## Requirements
In order to run this you need to have:
  1. Python 3.5 (or higher)
  2. Numpy
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Pandas
  5. Seaborne
  
  
## Usage
Fir Iris Dataset
```bash
Iris Data set EDA.ipynb
```

For haberman
```bash
haberman EDA.ipynb
```

## Purpose
This was my first machine learning project.


## Contributing
Any suggestions in improving are appreciated.


This dataset is available as cvs file in the same repository.
